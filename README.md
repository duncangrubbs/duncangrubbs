## Hey ðŸ‘‹, I'm Duncan

I'm a software engineer at [Predata](https://predata.com/) and a founding software engineer at [Flowlie](https://www.flowlie.com/), an early stage startup creating the next generation data infrastructure for angels, VCs, syndicators, and startups. I previously worked at [BNY Mellon](https://www.bnymellon.com/) as a production services analyst focusing on automation engineering and [FiscalNote](https://fiscalnote.com/) as a data science intern mostly working on NLP and machine vision pipelines.

Feel free to reach out and ask me about building early-stage startups!
