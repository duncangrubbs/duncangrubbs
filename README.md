## Hey ðŸ‘‹, I'm Duncan

I work in automation engineering at [BNY Mellon](https://www.bnymellon.com/), building tools that help software teams deploy, monitor and maintain services at scale. In my spare time I also do a lot of software development.

Back in 2018/19 I helped build [BarterOut](https://github.com/BarterOut), a peer-to-peer textbook exchange platform.
I am currently helping to build [Flowlie](https://www.flowlie.com/), the future data-infrastructure for VC! I am also working on side projects like [ozzy](https://github.com/duncangrubbs/ozzy) and [Dinner Time](https://github.com/duncangrubbs/dinner-time), which may be finished some day...

Feel free to reach out and ask me about building student-run/early-stage startups!
