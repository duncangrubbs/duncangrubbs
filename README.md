## Hey ðŸ‘‹, I'm Duncan

I'm a software engineer at [FiscalNote](https://fiscalnote.com/) working on applying AI to geopolitical and supply-chain risk. I previously was a founding software engineer at [Flowlie](https://www.flowlie.com/), an early-stage startup creating the modern operating system for venture fundraising, and a production services analyst at [BNY Mellon](https://www.bnymellon.com/) focusing on automation engineering.

Feel free to reach out and ask me about building early-stage startups!
