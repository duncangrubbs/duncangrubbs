## Hey ðŸ‘‹, I'm Duncan

I'm a software engineer at [FiscalNote](https://fiscalnote.com/) and a founding software engineer at [Flowlie](https://www.flowlie.com/), an early-stage startup creating the modern operating system for venture fundraising. I previously worked at [BNY Mellon](https://www.bnymellon.com/) as a production services analyst focusing on automation engineering and [Predata](https://predata.com/) as a software engineer.

Feel free to reach out and ask me about building early-stage startups!
