## Hey ðŸ‘‹, I'm Duncan

I'm a software engineer at [FiscalNote](https://fiscalnote.com/). I work on data-forward products that utilize LLMs to inform decision makers around the world on geopolitical, supply chain, and legislative risk. I previously was a founding software engineer at [Flowlie](https://www.flowlie.com/), an early stage startup creating the modern operating system for venture fundraising.
