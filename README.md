## Hey ðŸ‘‹, I'm Duncan

I'm a software engineer at [Dow Jones](https://www.dowjones.com/). I work on data-forward products that utilize LLMs to inform decision makers around the world on geopolitical risk. I previously was a software engineer at [FiscalNote](https://fiscalnote.com) and a founding software engineer at [Flowlie](https://www.flowlie.com/), an early stage startup creating the modern operating system for venture fundraising.
