## Hey ðŸ‘‹, I'm Duncan

By day I am a software engineer at [Predata](https://predata.com), working on presenting insights for shifts in online attention. In my spare time I am helping to build [Flowlie](https://www.flowlie.com/), the future data-infrastructure for VC! I am also working on side projects like [ozzy](https://github.com/duncangrubbs/ozzy) and [Dinner Time](https://github.com/duncangrubbs/dinner-time), which may be finished some day...

Feel free to reach out and ask me about building student-run/early-stage startups!
