## Hey ðŸ‘‹, I'm Duncan

I'm a production services analyst at [BNY Mellon](https://www.bnymellon.com/), but in my spare time I do a lot of software development.

Back in 2018/19 I helped build [BarterOut](https://github.com/BarterOut), a peer-to-peer textbook exchange platform.
I am currently helping to build [Flowlie](https://www.flowlie.com/), a super exciting startup! I am also working on side projects like [ozzy](https://github.com/duncangrubbs/ozzy) and [Dinner Time](https://github.com/duncangrubbs/dinner-time), which may be finished some day...

Feel free to reach out and ask me about API design, Javascript, and building student-run/early-stage startups!
